Autopilot Subsystem
-------------------
The autopilot service is located in the folder "service",
along with a debug logger service.
Folder "shell" provides an interactive Python-based command shell
for controlling the autopilot manually.
The logging framework located in "logging" consists of a
general "text-based" status logger and a real-time
binary "debugging" logger.
